                    <p>I am a dedicated, energetic student studying journalism at the Philip Merrill College of
                        Journalism
                        at the University of Maryland, College Park.</p>

                    <p> During the last three years at UMD, I have furthered my interest in entertainment media through
                        my work with WMUC News, the university’s flagship radio news program. After working as a
                        reporter for a year and a half I was promoted to producer for the station’s pop culture news
                        hour. As a senior I now hold the position as News Director and direct and produce our two weekly
                        shows.</p>

                    <p>I also serve as the Secretary of UMD's Society of Professional Journalists and have written
                        articles for Stories Beneath the Shell, an online campus publication. Additionally, I have
                        enhanced my public speaking and communication skills through my work as a campus tour guide and
                        my continued leadership in the organization, all while building upon my reporting and research
                        skills through the journalism program in College Park and the internships I’ve held.</p>

                    <p>My course load includes news writing and reporting for multi-media and broadcast, social
                        engagement and analytics, copyediting and videography. Open to opportunities involving audio and
                        podcast reporting, editing or social media engagement.</p>

                    <p>When I’m not directing news broadcasts, giving university tours, or working my on-campus jobs,
                        you can find me listening to podcasts, hanging out with friends, or reminiscing about my study
                        abroad semester in Rome.
                    </p>
