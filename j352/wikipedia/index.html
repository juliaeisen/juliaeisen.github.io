    <p> The Empire State Building is a 102-story[c] Art Deco skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. The
        building was designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon and built from 1930 to 1931. Its name is derived from "Empire
        State", the nickname of the state of New York. The building has a roof height of 1,250 feet (380 m) and stands a
        total of 1,454 feet (443.2 m) tall, including its antenna. The Empire State Building stood as the world's
        tallest building until the construction of the World Trade Center in 1970; following the latter's collapse in
        2001, the Empire State Building reverted to being the city's tallest skyscraper until that title was surpassed
        in 2012. As of 2022, the building is the seventh-tallest building in New York City, the ninth-tallest completed
        skyscraper in the United States, the 54th-tallest in the world, and the sixth-tallest freestanding structure in
        the Americas. </p>

    <p> The site of the Empire State Building, in Midtown South on the west side of Fifth Avenue between West 33rd and
        34th Streets, was developed in 1893 as the Waldorf–Astoria Hotel. In 1929, Empire State Inc. acquired the site
        and devised plans for a skyscraper there. The design for the Empire State Building was changed fifteen times
        until it was ensured to be the world's tallest building. Construction started on March 17, 1930, and the
        building opened thirteen and a half months afterward on May 1, 1931. Despite favorable publicity related to the
        building's construction, because of the Great Depression and World War II, its owners did not make a profit
        until the early 1950s. </p>

    <p>The building's Art Deco architecture, height, and observation decks have made it a popular attraction. Around
        four million tourists from around the world annually visit the building's 86th- and 102nd-floor observatories;
        an additional indoor observatory on the 80th floor opened in 2019. The Empire State Building is an international
        cultural icon: it has been featured in more than 250 television series and films since the film King Kong was
        released in 1933. The building's size has become the global standard of reference to describe the height and
        length of other structures. A symbol of New York City, the building has been named as one of the Seven Wonders
        of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It was ranked first on the American Institute of
        Architects' List of America's Favorite Architecture in 2007. Additionally, the Empire State Building and its
        ground-floor interior were designated city landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in
        1980, and were added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1986.</p>

    <h2>Site</h2>

    <p>The Empire State Building is located on the west side of Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, between 33rd Street
        to the south and 34th Street to the north.[16] Tenants enter the building through the Art Deco lobby located at
        350 Fifth Avenue. Visitors to the observatories use an entrance at 20 West 34th Street; prior to August 2018,
        visitors entered through the Fifth Avenue lobby.[1] Although physically located in South Midtown,[17] a mixed
        residential and commercial area,[18] the building is so large that it was assigned its own ZIP Code,
        10118;[19][20] as of 2012, it is one of 43 buildings in New York City that have their own ZIP codes.[21][b]</p>

    <p>The areas surrounding the Empire State Building are home to other major points of interest, including Macy's at
        Herald Square on Sixth Avenue and 34th Street,[24] and Koreatown on 32nd Street between Madison and Sixth
        Avenues.[24][25] To the east of the Empire State Building is Murray Hill,[26] a neighborhood with a mix of
        residential, commercial, and entertainment activity.[27] The block directly to the northeast contains the B.
        Altman and Company Building, which houses the City University of New York's Graduate Center, while the Demarest
        Building is directly across Fifth Avenue to the east.[28] The nearest New York City Subway stations are 34th
        Street–Herald Square, one block west, and 33rd Street at Park Avenue, two blocks east; there is also a PATH
        station at 33rd Street and Sixth Avenue.[26]</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The site was previously owned by John Jacob Astor of the prominent Astor family, who had owned the site since the
        mid-1820s.[149][150] In 1893, John Jacob Astor Sr.'s grandson William Waldorf Astor opened the Waldorf Hotel on
        the site.[151][152] Four years later, his cousin, John Jacob Astor IV, opened the 16-story Astoria Hotel on an
        adjacent site.[65][151][153] The two portions of the Waldorf–Astoria hotel had 1,300 bedrooms, making it the
        largest hotel in the world at the time.[154] After the death of its founding proprietor, George Boldt, in early
        1918, the hotel lease was purchased by Thomas Coleman du Pont.[155][156] By the 1920s, the old Waldorf–Astoria
        was becoming dated and the elegant social life of New York had moved much farther north.[157][39][158]
        Additionally, many stores had opened on Fifth Avenue north of 34th Street.[159][160] The Astor family decided to
        build a replacement hotel on Park Avenue[151][161] and sold the hotel to Bethlehem Engineering Corporation in
        1928 for $14–16 million.[157] The hotel closed shortly thereafter on May 3, 1929.[65]</p>

    <h3>Planning</h3>
    <h4>Construction</h4>
    <p>The contractors were Starrett Brothers and Eken, which were composed of Paul and William A. Starrett and Andrew
        J. Eken.[189] The project was financed primarily by Raskob and Pierre du Pont,[190] while James Farley's General
        Builders Supply Corporation supplied the building materials.[2] John W. Bowser was the construction
        superintendent of the project,[191] and the structural engineer of the building was Homer G. Balcom.[171][192]
        The tight completion schedule necessitated the commencement of construction even though the design had yet to be
        finalized.[193]</p>
    <h5>Hotel Demolition</h5>
    <p>Demolition of the old Waldorf–Astoria began on October 1, 1929.[194] Stripping the building down was an arduous
        process, as the hotel had been constructed using more rigid material than earlier buildings had been.
        Furthermore, the old hotel's granite, wood chips, and "'precious' metals such as lead, brass, and zinc" were not
        in high demand resulting in issues with disposal.[195] Most of the wood was deposited into a woodpile on nearby
        30th Street or was burned in a swamp elsewhere. Much of the other materials that made up the old hotel,
        including the granite and bronze, were dumped into the Atlantic Ocean near Sandy Hook, New Jersey.[196][197]</p>

    <p>By the time the hotel's demolition started, Raskob had secured the required funding for the construction of the
        building.[198] The plan was to start construction later that year but, on October 24, the New York Stock
        Exchange experienced the major and sudden Wall Street Crash, marking the beginning of the decade-long Great
        Depression. Despite the economic downturn, Raskob refused to cancel the project because of the progress that had
        been made up to that point.[168] Neither Raskob, who had ceased speculation in the stock market the previous
        year, nor Smith, who had no stock investments, suffered financially in the crash.[198] However, most of the
        investors were affected and as a result, in December 1929, Empire State Inc. obtained a $27.5 million loan from
        Metropolitan Life Insurance Company so construction could begin.[199] The stock market crash resulted in no
        demand for new office space; Raskob and Smith nonetheless started construction,[200] as canceling the project
        would have resulted in greater losses for the investors.[168]

    </p>
    <h5>Steel Structure</h5>
    <p>A structural steel contract was awarded on January 12, 1930,[201] with excavation of the site beginning ten days
        later on January 22,[202] before the old hotel had been completely demolished.[203] Two twelve-hour shifts,
        consisting of 300 men each, worked continuously to dig the 55-foot (17 m) foundation.[202] Small pier holes were
        sunk into the ground to house the concrete footings that would support the steelwork.[204] Excavation was nearly
        complete by early March,[205] and construction on the building itself started on March 17,[206][2] with the
        builders placing the first steel columns on the completed footings before the rest of the footings had been
        finished.[207] Around this time, Lamb held a press conference on the building plans. He described the reflective
        steel panels parallel to the windows, the large-block Indiana Limestone facade that was slightly more expensive
        than smaller bricks, and the building's vertical lines.[185] Four colossal columns, intended for installation in
        the center of the building site, were delivered; they would support a combined 10,000,000 pounds (4,500,000 kg)
        when the building was finished.[208]</p>

    <p>The structural steel was pre-ordered and pre-fabricated in anticipation of a revision to the city's building code
        that would have allowed the Empire State Building's structural steel to carry 18,000 pounds per square inch
        (120,000 kPa), up from 16,000 pounds per square inch (110,000 kPa), thus reducing the amount of steel needed for
        the building. Although the 18,000-psi regulation had been safely enacted in other cities, Mayor Jimmy Walker did
        not sign the new codes into law until March 26, 1930, just before construction was due to commence.[206][209]
        The first steel framework was installed on April 1, 1930.[210] From there, construction proceeded at a rapid
        pace; during one stretch of 10 working days, the builders erected fourteen floors.[211][2] This was made
        possible through precise coordination of the building's planning, as well as the mass production of common
        materials such as windows and spandrels.[212] On one occasion, when a supplier could not provide timely delivery
        of dark Hauteville marble, Starrett switched to using Rose Famosa marble from a German quarry that was purchased
        specifically to provide the project with sufficient marble.[204]</p>

    <p>The scale of the project was massive, with trucks carrying "16,000 partition tiles, 5,000 bags of cement, 450
        cubic yards [340 m3] of sand and 300 bags of lime" arriving at the construction site every day.[213] There were
        also cafes and concession stands on five of the incomplete floors so workers did not have to descend to the
        ground level to eat lunch.[3][214] Temporary water taps were also built so workers did not waste time buying
        water bottles from the ground level.[3][215] Additionally, carts running on a small railway system transported
        materials from the basement storage[3] to elevators that brought the carts to the desired floors where they
        would then be distributed throughout that level using another set of tracks.[213][85][214] The 57,480 short tons
        (51,320 long tons) of steel ordered for the project was the largest-ever single order of steel at the time,
        comprising more steel than was ordered for the Chrysler Building and 40 Wall Street combined.[216][217]
        According to historian John Tauranac, building materials were sourced from numerous, and distant, sources with
        "limestone from Indiana, steel girders from Pittsburgh, cement and mortar from upper New York State, marble from
        Italy, France, and England, wood from northern and Pacific Coast forests, [and] hardware from New England."[211]
        The facade, too, used a variety of material, most prominently Indiana limestone but also Swedish black granite,
        terracotta, and brick.[218]</p>

    <p>By June 20, the skyscraper's supporting steel structure had risen to the 26th floor, and by July 27, half of the
        steel structure had been completed.[213] Starrett Bros. and Eken endeavored to build one floor a day in order to
        speed up construction, a goal that they almost reached with their pace of 4+1⁄2 stories per week;[219][104]
        prior to this, the fastest pace of construction for a building of similar height had been 3+1⁄2 stories per
        week.[219] While construction progressed, the final designs for the floors were being designed from the ground
        up (as opposed to the general design, which had been from the roof down). Some of the levels were still
        undergoing final approval, with several orders placed within an hour of a plan being finalized.[219] On
        September 10, as steelwork was nearing completion, Smith laid the building's cornerstone during a ceremony
        attended by thousands. The stone contained a box with contemporary artifacts including the previous day's New
        York Times, a U.S. currency set containing all denominations of notes and coins minted in 1930, a history of the
        site and building, and photographs of the people involved in construction.[220][221] The steel structure was
        topped out at 1,048 feet (319 m) on September 19, twelve days ahead of schedule and 23 weeks after the start of
        construction.[222] Workers raised a flag atop the 86th floor to signify this milestone.[219][223]</p>
