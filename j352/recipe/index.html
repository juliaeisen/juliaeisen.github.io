    <h1>Yogurt Feta Sauce</h1>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Yogurt feta sauce is the perfect dipping sauce for any fish, meat, poultry. Any finger food will be enhanced by
        this dish.</p>

    <p>Fresh lemons are in season and what a better way to put them to use than to combine them with feta cheese and
        fresh herbs.</p>

    <p>One of my favorite sauce recipes is Tzatziki which is based on lemon, garlic, and yogurt. Adding the feta cheese,
        which is a pungent fresh cheese, adds a new dimension to this wonderful dipping sauce recipe.</p>

    <p>A touch of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cooking is ready in a few pulses of your food processor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>½ cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>½ cup Italian flat-leaf parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup crumble feta cheese - be generous</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced chives</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Perparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>With the flat side of a knife, mash the garlic with the salt until reduced to a paste.</li>
        <li>Combine all the above ingredients as well as the garlic paste, in a food processor and process until well
            combined.</li>
    </ol>
