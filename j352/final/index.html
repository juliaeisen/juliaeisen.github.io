            <p>The University of Maryland’s fall 2022 freshman class has more Black students and Asian students than
                last fall’s freshman class, according to new data released by the university’s institutional
                research,
                planning and assessment office (IRPA). All this comes as the university’s President Darryll Pines
                continues to push agendas of diversity, equity and inclusion. </p>

            <p>Pines’ creation of the <a href="https://terrapinstrong.umd.edu/" target="_blank">"TerrapinSTRONG"</a>
                program was his first step in his presidency to a more
                diverse
                campus.
            </p>

            <p>TerrapinSTRONG’s message promotes the idea “to engage diversity, acknowledge our history, show
                Terrapin
                pride and take action to advance equity, inclusion and social justice.”

            <p>While the University of Maryland is a predominately white institution (PWI), the demographics are
                shifting in favor of a more diverse student body.
            </p>

            <p><a href="https://reports.umd.edu/tableaupublic/1813" target="_blank">The IRPA data</a> shows that the
                number of Black or African American students enrolled in the
                university’s freshman class increased by 18 percent. The number of Asian students enrolled in the
                university’s freshman class increased by 16 percent.
            </p>

            <p>The total number of students of color at the University of Maryland is the highest it’s ever been in
                the
                last 10 years. </p>

            <p>As of last academic year’s data 45.3 percent of degree-seeking undergraduates were non-Hispanic white
                students. That is compared to 56.4 percent of the student body a decade earlier.
            </p>

            <p>Hispanics are the fourth-largest racial demographic at the University of Maryland. 10.2 percent of
                the
                degree-seeking undergraduate student population are Hispanic, according to the 2021-2022 from the
                university’s institutional research, planning and assessment office. However, the fall 2022 freshman
                class has less enrolled Hispanic students than the class prior. </p>

            <p>The number of enrolled freshman Hispanic students declined about four percent, according to the IRPA
                report.
            </p>

            <p>When it comes to admissions, the university’s admissions representatives look at applications
                thoroughly.
            </p>

            <p>“Our read [of the application] is extremely holistic,” Marianne Virnelson, a UMD Visitor Experience
                Representative said. “We are always trying to put these students in the best light possible.”
            </p>

            <p>For the upcoming fall 2023 class, there were around 40,000 applications submitted by the priority
                deadline, according to Virnelson.
            </p>


            <p>There are 26 factors that application readers look for, with race and gender being part of the
                application. </p>

            <p>“We use demographics as additional context. Historically, there are points of evidence that show that
                students who experience more diverse classrooms, excel in the classroom. That’s what we want,”
                Virnelson
                said.
            </p>

            <p>Virnelson is not wrong. A more diverse cohort of students promotes teamwork and performance, improves
                cultural competency, and gives increased opportunities to students, according to the <a

            <p>While admission is the first step, pushing students of color towards success and giving them access
                to
                the same types of resources as white students is most important, Jordan Purcell, a graduate
                assistant
                for the Office of Multi-Ethnic Student Education said. </p>

            <p>On campus there are some resources available for students of color, such as the Office of
                Multi-Ethnic
                Student Education and the Academic Achievement Program for incoming freshman.</p>

            <p>Purcell thinks there could always be more. </p>

            <p>“We need to create spaces and implement more people of color into the learning experience, rather
                than
                just having somebody there,” Purcell said.
            </p>

            <p>He then joked that it’s tricky and if he could be the one to figure it out, “they’d pay [him] a
                million
                dollars.” </p>

            <p>While The IRPA office did not agree to an interview, its thorough reporting done each year gives enough
                insight for the UMD community to see that admissions of more students of color is the first step of a
                more diverse campus as a whole.
            </p>
